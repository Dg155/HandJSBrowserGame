4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I completed the assignment completely individually. I did have my two roommates playtest the game however.


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Be careful with the restart option because the hand tracker is not 100% accurate so if your site randomly reloads it is
because the tracker thought it saw an input for the restart option.

--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
The arcade teenager, wanting to play something short and fun :)

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
The first one is a combination of the open and closed hand, used to restart the game.
The second is a combination of the closed and pointing hand, used to mute and unmute the sound.

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
The color pallete is consistent. It is scalable with the size of the screen (to an extent, the website is not meant to run
on phones or smaller screens). There is good use of spacing between different elements along with the use of proximity for
relating the hand icons to their actions.
